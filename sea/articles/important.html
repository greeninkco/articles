<h3>What it Has</h3><p>The ocean covers nearly 70% of our planet's surface, it may seem like it's just a large body of water; however it's more of a large ecosystem that plays a crucial role in keeping life on Earth. It provides oxygen, regulates the climate, and has biodiversity to offer food and things necessary to live for millions, the ocean is undeniably vital to the health and well-being of both the planet and its inhabitants.</p><h3>What it Provides</h3><p>The ocean provides nearly 50-85% of the world's oxygen, which keeps us alive. The ocean also has kept our climate regulated by absorbing most of the sun's heat rather than releasing it into the atmosphere. It has millions of life forms inside of it and without it that life would die. The ocean also gives us a lot of food and medicines such as anti-cancers.</p><h3>Cultural Significance</h3><p>Throughout history, the ocean has held profound cultural significance for coastal communities and societies around the world. It has inspired art, literature, mythology, and spiritual practices, shaping human culture in countless ways. Preserving the ocean's health is not only an ecological imperative but also a cultural responsibility.</p>
