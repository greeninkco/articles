<h1> The Algae Bloom </h1>

<p>
   By <a href='../../writers/lukeescoto.html'>Luke Escoto</a>

<h3></h3><p>For those who don’t know, algae is a microscopic organism that can be found in every water source (besides in pools). This organism is plant like as it goes through the process of photosynthesis. The problem is that algae has been growing in various places that are producing toxins, and some are nearly impossible to see with it growing at the bottom of water bodies.  </p><h3>What has this been doing?</h3><p>The hazardous algae has the capability of depleting the oxygen in water which can kill all the creatures that depend upon the oxygen in the area. The algae can also block sunlight from getting to the creatures in deeper parts of the ocean. This algae can also affect us through us coming into contact with this through consuming fish, drinking contaminated water. Some of the effects caused by the absorption of the toxins include: paralysis, vomiting, diarrhea, seizures, confusion, permanent short term memory loss, and on rare occasions death</p><h3>Have we done anything to stop it? </h3><p>One institute I can name that has been monitoring the growth of the hazardous organism has been the National Institute of Environmental Health Science (NIH). They have developed techniques in order to improve the detection of algae blooms to prevent and reduce exposure. The NIH has also researched ways to better improve how to lower the amount of algae blooms.</p>
