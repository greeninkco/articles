<h1> Is Team Seas a Scam? </h1>

<h3>What is Team Seas?</h3><p>Team Seas is a fundraiser that is run by Mr. Beast that started running in 2021 in order to raise 30 million dollars to remove 30 million pounds of trash. He has accomplished this goal since then and has removed the trash. People still donate and he still removes trash. It started as a follow up to Team Trees because he reached 30 million subscribers. Mr. Beast and Mark Rober both worked on the removal of trash and did so in several countries.</p><h3>Did it Scam Anyone?</h3><p>The answer is no they did not scam anyone, everyone who paid got trash removed. Some people would still pay after the fact and he still removes trash. No one was scammed in the process of paying for Team Seas because they knew that when they paid they would get what they get.</p><h3>Is it Worth Donating to Team Seas still?</h3><p>Of course it is, if you donate to Team Seas you get trash removed, and the world needs less trash. Donating to Team Seas is a great way for someone to remove trash if they can’t remove trash themselves, plus it only costs a dollar. It is by far the best and easiest way to help the environment without doing work for yourself.</p>
